A project is a library, application, package, binary, tool, etc, that contains source files, test
files, assets, resources, and more. A project must exist and be configured within a
[workspace](https://moonrepo.dev/docs/concepts/workspace).

## IDs [​](https://moonrepo.dev/docs/concepts/project\#ids "Direct link to IDs")

A project identifier (or name) is a unique resource for locating a project. The ID is explicitly
configured within [`.moon/workspace.*`](https://moonrepo.dev/docs/config/workspace), as a key within the
[`projects`](https://moonrepo.dev/docs/config/workspace#projects) setting, and can be written in camel/kebab/snake case.
IDs support alphabetic unicode characters, `0-9`, `_`, `-`, `/`, `.`, and must start with a
character.

IDs are used heavily by configuration and the command line to link and reference everything. They're
also a much easier concept for remembering projects than file system paths, and they typically can
be written with less key strokes.

Lastly, a project ID can be paired with a task ID to create a [target](https://moonrepo.dev/docs/concepts/target).

## Aliases [​](https://moonrepo.dev/docs/concepts/project\#aliases "Direct link to Aliases")

Aliases are a secondary approach for naming projects, and can be used as a drop-in replacement for
standard names. What this means is that an alias can also be used when configuring dependencies, or
defining [targets](https://moonrepo.dev/docs/concepts/target).

However, the difference between aliases and names is that aliases _can not_ be explicit configured
in moon. Instead, they are derived from toolchain's that have been detected for the project. For
example, a JavaScript project will use the `name` field from its `package.json` as the alias.

Because of this, a project can either be referenced by its name or alias, or both. Choose the
pattern that makes the most sense for your company or team!

## Dependencies [​](https://moonrepo.dev/docs/concepts/project\#dependencies "Direct link to Dependencies")

Projects can depend on other projects within the [workspace](https://moonrepo.dev/docs/concepts/workspace) to build a
[project graph](https://moonrepo.dev/docs/how-it-works/action-graph), and in turn, an action graph for executing
[tasks](https://moonrepo.dev/docs/concepts/task). Project dependencies are divided into 2 categories:

- **Explicit dependencies** \- These are dependencies that are explicitly defined in a project's
[`moon.*`](https://moonrepo.dev/docs/config/project) config file, using the [`dependsOn`](https://moonrepo.dev/docs/config/project#dependson)
setting.
- **Implicit dependencies** \- These are dependencies that are implicitly discovered by moon when
scanning the repository. How an implicit dependency is discovered is based on the project's
[`language`](https://moonrepo.dev/docs/config/project#language) setting, and how that language's ecosystem functions.

## Configuration [​](https://moonrepo.dev/docs/concepts/project\#configuration "Direct link to Configuration")

Projects can be configured with an optional [`moon.*`](https://moonrepo.dev/docs/config/project) in the project root, or
through the optional workspace-level [`.moon/tasks/**/*`](https://moonrepo.dev/docs/config/tasks).
